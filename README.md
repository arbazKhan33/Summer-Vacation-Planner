# Summer-Vacation-Planner
This Python program facilitates summer vacation planning by allowing users to select a destination, airline, number of passengers, and calculates airfare costs with discounts for travelers under 18. 
It employs four functions to streamline the process.

Write a Python program to choose one of the following two options for your summer vacation. Your options are:
    
    1.	Hawaii
    2.	Bahamas
    3.	Cancun

Your program should select one of the above options using if…elif…else statements and Menu. 
Once an option is selected, your program should select one of the following two options using. 
if…else if…else if…else statement and Menu for airline company. 

    1.	US Air
    2.	Delta
    3.	United

Once one of the above options is selected, your program should read the air fare for 
a round trip. Your program should also select one of the following three options for number of 
passengers using if…elif…else statements and Menu:

    1.	One person
    2.	Two persons
    3.	Three persons
    4.	Four persons

Once number of passengers is read, then your program should ask how many passengers are underage of 18. There will be 25% discount for underage travelers.
Compute the total cost of air fare for one family. Display total round trip ticket price for adults, total round trip ticket price for person(s) underage of 18, 
total cost of vacation, airline company name, vacation location.  

Four functions will be created.

1.	A function called calculation() to perform and display all the different airfare calculations 

2.	A function called passenger() to perform the menu selection of the number of passengers,  display the number of persons traveling and call the function calculation()

3.	A function called carrier() to perform the menu selection of the airplane company, display the carrier name and call the function passenger()

4.	A function main() to perform the menu selection of the vacation destination,  display the chosen vacation destination and call the function carrier()
